    <h1>How to use the dedicated server</h1>

    <h2>Recommended Hardware</h2>
    <p>
        We recommend running the Bedrock Minecraft Server on 64-bit Intel or AMD processor machines with at least 2 cores and 1 Gb RAM.
    </p>

    <h2>Platforms</h2>

    <h3>Linux</h3>
    <p>
        The Linux version of the Bedrock Server requires Ubuntu 18 or later. Other distributions are not supported.
        Unzip the container file into an empty folder. Start the server with the following command:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./bedrock_server
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>
        The Windows version of the Bedrock Server requires either:
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Windows 10 version 1703 or later</li>
            <li>Windows Server 2016 or later</li>
        </ul>
        Unzip the container file into an empty folder. Start the server by executing the <code>bedrock_server.exe</code> file.
    </p>
    <p>
        On some systems, when you wish to connect to the server using a client running on the same machine as the
        server is running on, you will need to exempt the Minecraft client from UWP loopback restrictions:
        <blockquote>CheckNetIsolation.exe LoopbackExempt -a -p=S-1-15-2-1958404141-86561845-1752920682-3514627264-368642714-62675701-733520436</blockquote>.
    </p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        The server will try to read a file named <code>server.properties</code>. Some of these options are only read when a new world is created, while some others are read every startup. The file should contain a list with keys and values separated with an equal sign, one per line.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following options are available. If a value as a number in parenthesis, that number can be used instead of the text value.
    </p>

    <h2>Folders</h2>
    <p>
        When unpacking you will see a few folders and the binary executable. When starting the server for the first time a bunch of new (empty) folders will be created. The folders you should care about are the following:
    </p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Folder name</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>behavior_packs</td>
                <td>This is where new behavior packs can be installed. At the moment there's no way of activating
                            them in a level.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>resource_packs</td>
                <td>This is where new resource packs can be installed. At the moment there's no way of activating
                            them in a level.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>worlds</td>
                <td>This folder will be created at startup if it doesn't already exist. Every world created will have a folder named according to their <code>level-name</code> inside the <code>server.properties</code> file.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Allowlist</h2>
    <p>
        If the <code>allow-list</code> property is enabled in <code>server.properties</code> then the server will only allow selected users to connect. To allow a user to connect you need to know their Xbox Live Gamertag. The easiest way to add a user to the allowlist is to use the command <code>allowlist add &lt;Gamertag&gt;</code> (eg: <code>allowlist add ExampleName</code>). Note: If there is a white-space in the Gamertag you need to enclose it with double quotes: <code>allowlist add "Example Name"</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you later want to remove someone from the list you can use the command <code>allowlist remove &lt;Gamertag&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The allowlist will be saved in a file called <code>allowlist.json</code>. If you want to automate the process of adding or removing players from it you can do so. After you've modified the file you need to run the command <code>allowlist reload</code> to make sure that the server knows about your new change.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b> This file was previously named <code>whitelist.json</code>. For backwards compatability, if a <code>whitelist.json</code> file is also present, it will be used instead of <code>allowlist.json</code>.
        To migrate, delete the default <code>allowlist.json</code> file, rename <code>whitelist.json</code> to <code>allowlist.json</code>, then restart the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        The file contains a JSON array with objects that contains the following key/values.
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Key</th>

                <td>String</td>
                <td>Optional. The XUID of the user. If it's not set then it will be populated when someone with a matching name connects.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ignoresPlayerLimit</td>
                <td>Boolean</td>
                <td>True if this user should not count towards the maximum player limit. Currently there's another soft limit of 30 (or 1 higher than the specified number of max players) connected players, even if players use this option. The intention for this is to have some players be able to join even if the server is full.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>

        Example <code>allowlist.json</code> file:

        "xuid": "274817248"
    }
]</pre>



    <h2>Packet Rate Limit Config</h2>
    <p>
        If the <code>enable-packet-rate-limiter</code> property is enabled in <code>server.properties</code>, the server will use the packet rate limiter feature. Following the configuration described by the <code>packetlimitconfig.json</code> file, specific types of packets will be limited and rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
        To reload the packet rate limiter configuration on the flight, use the server command <code>reloadpacketlimitconfig</code>. The server will reload the configuration from the <code>packetlimitconfig.json</code> file and update it for all of its clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>packetlimitconfig.json</code> file contains a JSON array with a list of limit groups. Each group contains a list of packet ids and the corresponding packet rate limit algorithm that will be applied to them. Only <code>BucketPacketLimitAlgorithm</code> is currently supported. Additionally, the file can also use a default algorithm that will be applied to limit the rate for all packet types, on top of the ones specified by the limit groups.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>BucketPacketLimitAlgorithm</code> requires two parameters:

    }
}</pre>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        You can adjust player specific permissions by assigning them roles in the <code>permissions.json</code> that is placed in the same directory as the server executable. The file contains a simple JSON object with XUIDs and permissions. Valid permissions are: <code>operator</code>, <code>member</code>, <code>visitor</code>. Every player that connects with these accounts will be treated according to the set premission. If you change this file while the server is running, then run the command <code>permission reload</code> to make sure that the server knows about your new change. You could also list the current permissions with <code>permission list</code>. Note that <code>online-mode</code> needs to be enabled for this feature to work since xuid requires online verification of the user account. If a new player that is not in this list connects, the <code>default-player-permission-level</code> option will apply.

    </p>
    <p>
        Example <code>permissions.json</code> file:
    </p>

    <pre>
[
    {
        "permission": "operator",
        "xuid": "451298348"
    },
    {
        "permission": "member",
        "xuid": "52819329"
    },
    {
        "permission": "visitor",
        "xuid": "234114123"
    }
]</pre>

    <h2>Crash reporting</h2>
    <p>
        If the server crashes it will automatically send us various information that helps us solve it for the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Commands</h2>
    <p>
        You can issue commands to the server by typing in the console. The following commands are available. &lt; &gt; means a parameter is required, [ ] means it's optional and | denotes different allowed values. Strings can be enclosed in double quotes, ", if they contain spaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Backups</h2>
    <p>
        The server supports taking backups of the world files while the server is running. It's not particularly friendly for taking manual backups, but works better when automated. The backup (from the servers perspective) consists of three commands.
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>

When it returns a success it will return a file list (with lengths for each file) of the files you need to copy. The server will not pause while this is happening, so some files can be modified while the backup is taking place. As long as you only copy the files in the given file list and truncate the copied files to the specified lengths, then the backup should be valid.</td>
